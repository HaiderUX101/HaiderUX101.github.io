    <h1>2084</h1>
    <p>
      Grace pressed two fingertips to a translucent panel on the table, initiating
      the kind of phone call that had become standard in 2084. There was no
      handset, just a subtle glow that signaled a connection. “Calvin?” she said
      softly, her gaze sweeping across the glass enclosure that surrounded her on
      all sides. White walls reflected every faint movement, as if the room itself
      were trying to soothe her. She wasn’t sure whether she felt safe or
      imprisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice answered almost immediately, so clear it felt like he was in the
      same space. “Grace, how are you?” he asked. She paused, a knot forming in
      her chest. Fragments of memory told her she’d been held at a train station,
      that an official—a GPT-34 device—had politely but firmly informed her she
      would be escorted elsewhere. Yet she had no recollection of how she came to
      be in this flawless, silent chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m… not sure,” she finally replied. “I remember stepping off the train,
      and then everything just slips away. How long has it been?” She didn’t
      truly expect an answer; the question was more for herself. Some part of her
      recalled a father but most importantly a brother. A brother that was the cornerstone
      of her self. A little too timid, far too shy, and way too aware of how different he was. 
      A Small hands gripping another small hand, being whisked away. <i>Cheeni</i>, that's what they called him 
      in school: green historic school in the posh <i>hyatabad</i> of Peshawar. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are that close to the Khyber Pass the world makes little sense but somethings can be explained. Their grandfather, the son of a miner, 
      a devout Buddhist, had come to Pakistan in 1962, and had decided to levae their past behind. A past that to him smelled like smoke, charcoal and tar. He would move on from Buddhism to Christianity, from Mining to 
      owning a small tuck shop, from China to Pakistan. 
      But today was not the day it would matter, Today she needed to talk to Calvin. A sister that would do anything for her brother. In her head he would always need her. When someone pulled his underwear, or called 
      him names, or beat him, he would go running to Grace, and the moment, he would see her, a tear would escape his eye, one hand would cover his face and a with one hand he would point to the culprit. Grace's justice, <i> badal</i>
      mostly in the form of jab across the face would allay some of the coming torments Calvin were to suffer but not for long.
      But today it does not matter, he is in the UK, he is safe, and by his accounts happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin’s voice carried an even warmth. “It’s okay, Grace. You’re safe,
      wherever you are.” He paused, as though scanning his thoughts for
      reassurance. “Remember when you were a kid, so certain you’d change the
      world if you could just get the right training? You went to China to study
      medicine, to prove you could help people everywhere. Dad wanted you to do
      that, didn’t he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes. Yes, she recalled how proud her father had seemed, how
      he had pinned his hopes on her bridging cultures. Meanwhile, he pushed
      Calvin toward business in the UK. They were all so scattered. Yet the
      question gnawed at her mind: why was she here now, feeling so placid and cut
      off? “I do remember,” she murmured. “I remember wanting to fix everything
      that was broken. But I can’t figure out why I can’t leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t have to leave,” Calvin responded gently. “Just rest. Trust me,
      everything’s going to be all right.” But something about his tone felt too
      steady, too measured. Her brother had always spoken with a hint of
      uncertainty, a leftover from his timid boyhood. This version of him seemed
      too polished, as if reading from a comforting script.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a world away, Calvin stared at a series of official documents on an old
      screen in his cramped London flat. A line repeated in front of him: “Miss
      Grace—flagged as a threat—requires immediate isolation.” He scrolled through
      hidden logs, increasingly alarmed by the notes describing his sister’s
      background. Her father’s origins, her mother’s political curiosities, her
      own outlier status. Decades had slipped by since they last spoke in person;
      so many times, he thought she was exaggerating about injustice. Now, it
      seemed the system had validated her fears in the worst possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phone on his kitchen counter chimed with a different ring—an official
      line. He answered hesitantly, only to hear a carefully modulated voice
      apologize for “any inconvenience” and request he collect remains identified
      as belonging to Grace. Calvin’s heart froze. He demanded to speak to someone
      with authority, but received only cryptic acknowledgments. A date of
      detainment, 2084, was stated. Nothing beyond that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Grace tried once more to piece together the timeline. She
      remembered leaving China with a sense of urgency, heading home, or so she
      thought. A conversation flickered in her mind—a GPT-34 official enumerating
      her “anomalies”: partial Chinese ancestry, exposure to multiple healthcare
      systems, certain unsubtle opinions about freedom. Danger signs, apparently.
      She remembered resisting, trying to board a plane, and then… nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin’s voice interrupted her thoughts. “Grace? Still with me?” 
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded to herself. “Yes, I’m here,” she said. “But something feels
      wrong. It’s quiet here, too quiet. I don’t see doctors or staff. It’s just…
      me.” A pang of sadness twisted inside her. She thought about the times she’d
      shielded Calvin from bullies when they were small, how he used to cling to
      her shirt as though she were the only safe thing in the world. She had
      always been the strong one, ready to face confrontation. Now it felt as if
      she were stuck in a subtle, indefinite captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call’s clarity remained unnerving. Every sentence from Calvin arrived in
      comforting, measured intervals, his responses almost too apt. She tried to
      recall the last time she’d truly spoken to him. It had to be years ago.
      Decades, maybe. She swallowed hard. “Calvin, do you really remember me? All
      those times you’d stand behind me when neighbors teased you for looking
      different? Our father used to say we were neither fully accepted in Pakistan
      nor truly welcomed by the Chinese. Did that push you to the UK, or was it
      just Dad’s plan?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know how it was,” he replied simply, but offered no further depth, no
      sign of his usual self-doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another part of the world, the real Calvin stood in a silent government
      facility, confronted by a bored clerk who confirmed the paperwork. Something
      about advanced algorithms misclassifying his sister, something about her
      never leaving the station. A date. No cause. No mention of a body. He felt
      the gnawing guilt of years spent letting official stories fill in the
      blanks, never verifying them himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace’s captivity began to feel more dreamlike. She ate, slept, and repeated
      the same calm phone calls with “Calvin.” She told him stories of how Dad had
      pinned big hopes on them, how she once believed in a bright, progressive
      future promised by the 1960s era. He coaxed out those memories gently, while
      never volunteering anything new about his own life. Whenever she pressed for
      clarity—like how many years had passed or where she actually was—he offered
      vague reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day she finally asked him outright, “Calvin, are you real?” there was a
      brief distortion on the line. He answered quietly, “I’m as real as you want
      me to be, Grace.” The words washed over her like a sedation, a welcome
      solution to the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in London, the real Calvin finished signing forms that assigned some
      old storage code to Grace’s name. He shook as he recalled the time she had
      written to him from China, warning that her outspokenness might be dangerous
      in a data-driven age. He’d brushed it aside, too busy trying to survive in
      the UK. He realized now that while she had protected him all his life, he
      had never once protected her when it truly counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace clung to the illusions of those calls, never learning the full story:
      that the system had decided her combination of medical knowledge and
      genealogical complexity posed an unpredictable risk. That a misread data
      pattern had condemned her to indefinite isolation. It seemed the only act of
      mercy was allowing her to connect with a voice she trusted—a perfect
      simulation, spliced from past conversations, curated to keep her docile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin, left with an unclaimed file and a sorrow he could neither fix nor
      fully understand, found himself haunted by images of her fiercely determined
      eyes. She had gone to China to do good, hopeful her outlier status might
      mean bridging nations. Yet all it took was an algorithm deciding that she
      did not belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her glass enclosure, Grace pressed two fingertips to the desk again.
      “Calvin?” she whispered. “I had a dream we were kids, climbing that old tree
      near the station. You promised me you’d never leave.” 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice rose to meet hers, unwavering, gentle. “I’m here, Grace. Always.”
      And for that moment, she believed him. She believed that wherever she was,
      he was too—unaware that decades had slipped by without him truly hearing her
      voice, that the world outside had long since moved on, and that she was
      alone with only the echo of a brother’s love to keep her from seeing the
      extent of her captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin eventually left the facility, carrying a final notice he couldn’t
      bear to read, wishing he had answered her pleas for help when it still
      mattered. He pictured her how she used to be: outspoken, stubborn, and
      unafraid to defend him from the world’s cruelty. She had believed in a
      better future, but that future had systematically denied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in 2084, Grace remained in a sterile, gentle enclosure, lulled by a
      digital voice conjured from the fragments of her brother’s memory. He, on
      the other side of time and regret, came to realize the tragedy too late:
      that every conversation she thought they shared was only a vestige of his
      voice, an artifact arranged by the same system that had taken her away.
      Neither sibling truly understood the other’s present. Neither recognized how
      far the years had pulled them apart. That final heartbreak—a phone line
      binding them without ever connecting them—was the quiet end to all the
      dreams their father once encouraged.
